What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
    HTTP protocol


explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
1- SPOF
    SPOF are bound to happen because this infrastructure has only one server and 
    one application server and one of every mandatory component and if any of them
    goes down the website will go down with it

2- Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
    Whenever we need to update of do maintenance on any of the components the website
    will go down becuase there is no other component to take over the one that is down

3- Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
    If the website gets too much traffic the server will not be able to handle it
    and the website will go down
