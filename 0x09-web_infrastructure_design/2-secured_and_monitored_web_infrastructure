For every additional element, why you are adding it
    1- Firewall
        we put a firewall to protect our server from attacks and to check the traffic that is coming to our server
    2- SSL certificate
        we put a SSL certificate to encrypt the traffic between the server and the client (security)
    3- Monitoring
        we put a monitoring tool to monitor the traffic that is coming to our server and to check if the server is working properly

What are firewalls for?
    They act as a barrier between the internet and the servers, providing protection against unauthorized access, malicious activities, and potential threats.

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
    The traffic is served over HTTPS to encrypt the traffic between the server and the client, protecting sensitive data from being intercepted by third parties.

What monitoring is used for?
    These clients collect and send data to a monitoring platform, allowing visibility into the infrastructure's performance, health, and security.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data
    The monitoring tool's clients collect data by monitoring: server metrics, network traffic, database performance, and application logs.

Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
    To monitor the web server's Queries Per Second (QPS), the monitoring tool can track the number of incoming requests to each web server over a specific time period.

ISSUES:
Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
    The traffic between the load balancer and the web servers is not encrypted, which means that the data is vulnerable to interception by third parties.

Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
    If the MySQL server goes down, the application will not be able to write to the database, which will result in a loss of data.

Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
    If one of the servers goes down, the application will not be able to function properly, which will result in a loss of data.
